TODO 
awesome publishers 
Dover (math books)
Manning, Packt (mainly fuss) and O'Reilly. 
Manning (MEAN series).

Harvard/Oxford/etc./MIT publishing
Wiley (rarely)
maybe some more but most of them are easily found via Wikipedia lists

Conferences
NeurIPS
Crypto related 
Also found via Wikipedia
Preprints: 
arxiv mainly. also bioarxiv (or biorxiv)
maybe some other stuff.

I hope this will be centralized. 

Google Scholar as a search system. There used to be more (SemanticScholar). So you can experiment.
